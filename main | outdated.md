Small note: Script is intelligent meaning it got permissions to do all the commands. For example if u wnat to add someonne to a private channel u would need to have the manage_channels permission No user with a @everyone or a normal member role cant execute commands that need those permissions. But inforamtions commaands or the fun commands (excluded from starting a nubmer game that cna only do admins) backingn up the server cant be done by anyone. so its safe for u to add it and u can be sure that it cant be used against you. | By the way the small note got a bit bigger lol
