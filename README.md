## GUIDE

# How to Set Up Bot Permissions in Discord

## 1. Create Roles for Your Bot

To ensure your bot functions as needed, you need to create at least two roles:
- **Bot Role (Top Hierarchy)**: This role will have all the necessary permissions for the bot to interact with the server. This role should be at the **top of the role hierarchy**.
- **Secondary Role (Lowest Hierarchy)**: This role will be optional for the bot and is mainly for organizational purposes. It won't grant any permissions but can be placed **anywhere in the member list** (e.g., above owner, below admin, or below members) depending on your preference.

## 2. Setting Up the Bot Role

- **Step 1**: Go to **Server Settings** > **Roles**.
- **Step 2**: Click on the **+** (Create a New Role) button to add a new role.
- **Step 3**: Name this role something like "Bot" or "Bot Permissions".
- **Step 4**: Assign **all permissions** that the bot needs to function (e.g., **Manage Messages**, **Send Messages**, **Manage Roles**, **Administrator**).
- **Step 5**: Place this role **at the top of the hierarchy**. This ensures that the bot can manage other roles and messages. To do this:
  - Under the **Roles** tab in **Server Settings**, click and drag this new "Bot" role to the top of the list of roles.

## 3. Setting Up the Secondary Role

- **Step 1**: Create a **Secondary Role** for the bot. This role may not have any permissions but is necessary for organizing the bot within the server.
- **Step 2**: Name this role something like "Bot Secondary" or just "Bot Role" (whatever works for your setup).
- **Step 3**: **Assign this role at the bottom of the hierarchy**.
  - Under **Server Settings** > **Roles**, drag this role to the very bottom of the role list.
  
  **Note**: The secondary role is mainly for organizing the bot's position in the **member list** on the side of Discord. It doesn't need to have permissions but can be used to place the bot **above, below, or among specific roles** (such as above the owner, below admins, or below members), depending on where you want it to show up.

## 4. Assigning Roles to the Bot

- **Step 1**: Go to your **Discord server** and click on the **Members** list.
- **Step 2**: Find your bot in the list of server members.
- **Step 3**: Right-click on the bot’s name, then click on **Roles** > Assign both the **Bot Role** (top of hierarchy) and **Secondary Role** (lowest in hierarchy).

## 5. Sorting by Hierarchy

- After assigning the roles, you need to ensure that the roles are sorted by hierarchy.
- In the **Role Settings**, under the **Roles** section, the topmost role will have the highest priority, and the lowest role will have the lowest priority. Ensure your bot’s main role is at the top.

## 6. Adjusting Permissions (if necessary)

- If your bot is not able to access certain channels or perform actions, it might be because the **bot's role** is not properly prioritized.
- Make sure no other roles with higher priority restrict access to the necessary permissions for the bot.

---

## Final Steps:

- **Test the bot**: Once the roles are set up, test the bot by asking it to perform tasks (such as sending messages or managing roles) to ensure that it has the required permissions.
- **Sort Roles**: Ensure that roles are sorted in the correct order in **Server Settings** > **Roles** tab (Bot Role at the top and Secondary Role at the bottom).

---

## Quick Recap of Hierarchy and Permissions:

- **Bot Role (Top)**: Has all permissions needed for bot operation.
- **Secondary Role (Bottom)**: Can be used for organizational purposes (it does not have any permissions), and determines the **bot’s position in the member list**.
- **Role Hierarchy**: Make sure to **sort by hierarchy** in **Server Settings** > **Roles** to keep the correct order. Place the **bot's secondary role** at the preferred position in the member list (above owner, below admin, or below members).



## Why Two Roles for the Bot?
Using two roles for your bot helps to separate its permissions from its visibility and organization within the server.

The main bot role (at the top of the hierarchy) grants all the necessary permissions the bot needs to interact with channels, manage messages, and perform its tasks.

The secondary role (at the bottom of the hierarchy) is purely for organizational purposes. It doesn’t have any permissions but determines the bot's position in the member list on the side of Discord, allowing you to control whether the bot appears above, below, or among specific roles like the owner or admins.


one last thing if u got multipel server adn want the same code/bot for it there is also a owner panel where u can hardcode ur discord id in it to execute cmd remotly annoucne leave servers u dont want the bot to be etc. 


# What is a `.env` File and Why Do You Need It for AdminBot?

A `.env` file (short for environment file) is a simple text file that stores environment variables. These variables are key-value pairs used to configure software applications without directly hardcoding sensitive or environment-specific data into your code.

---

## Why Use a `.env` File for AdminBot?
AdminBot uses a `.env` file to securely store essential configuration details and credentials required for its operation. This approach provides several key benefits:

### 1. **Secure Storage of Sensitive Data**
- Important credentials like Discord bot tokens and webhook URLs should not be directly included in the source code. Storing them in a `.env` file keeps them private and prevents accidental exposure on public platforms like GitHub.

### 2. **Environment-Specific Configuration**
- You can maintain different configurations for development, testing, and production environments by having separate `.env` files.

### 3. **Simplified Bot Setup**
- Instead of modifying the code directly, you can simply edit the `.env` file with your custom values.

---

## How to Create and Use a `.env` File

### **1. Create a `.env` File**
- In the same directory as the bot script, create a new file named `.env`.

### **2. Add Configuration Variables**
- Write your environment variables in the following format:
  ```
  BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
  LOGGING_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url
  BOT_OWNER_ID=your_discord_user_id
  ```

### **3. Load Variables in Your Bot**
- AdminBot already uses the `dotenv` library to read these variables. The line `load_dotenv()` in your code automatically reads the `.env` file.

---

## Sample `.env` File for AdminBot
```env
BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
LOGGING_WEBHOOK_URL=YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
BOT_OWNER_ID=YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID
```

> **Important Note:** Never share your `.env` file publicly, as it contains sensitive information.

---








## Why Not Hardcode the Token Directly?
Hardcoding sensitive credentials directly in your code is a security risk:
- If someone gains access to your source code (like via GitHub), they can steal your bot token and misuse it.
- Using a `.env` file keeps your sensitive data out of the codebase and easily manageable in different environments.

This approach is considered a best practice in software development for maintaining secure and maintainable applications.

# How to Deploy Your Project on Railway (Free Version)

## 1. Go to the Railway Website
- Open your browser and visit the official Railway website: [https://railway.com](https://railway.com).

## 2. Sign Up or Log In
- If you don’t have an account, create one by clicking the "Sign Up" button and following the instructions.
- If you already have an account, click "Log In" and enter your credentials.

## 3. Create or Open an Existing Environment (Project)
- After logging in, you’ll be taken to the Railway dashboard.
- If you don't already have an environment, click the "New Project" button and create one.
- If you already have an environment, just select the existing one where you want to deploy the project.

## 4. Connect Your GitHub Repository
- In your Railway environment, click the **"Connect a Repository"** button (or similar) to link your GitHub account to your Railway project.
- Choose **GitHub** as the source to deploy from.
- Log in to GitHub if prompted and authorize Railway to access your repositories.

## 5. Create a New Private GitHub Repository
- Open GitHub and create a new repository:
  - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and click on the "New Repository" button.
  - Name the repository something relevant to your project (e.g., `my-project`).
  - **Make sure the repository is set to private** to keep your code and configuration secure.
  - Optionally, initialize with a README, but **do not add a .gitignore or license** (you'll upload your files manually).
- Once the repository is created, drag and drop all your project files (the ones you received from me) into this repository on GitHub.
  - **Be sure to include your `.env` file** with any sensitive configurations.
  - Commit and push the changes.

## 6. Link the GitHub Repository to Railway
- After uploading your files to the GitHub repository, return to your Railway environment.
- In the **"Environment"** section, click the option to **"Link a GitHub Repository"** or **"Deploy from GitHub"**.
- Select the private GitHub repository you just created and click **"Deploy"**.
- Railway will automatically start the deployment process, but we need to configure some additional settings.

## 7. Configure Deployment Settings
- Once the deployment starts, go to the **Settings** section of your Railway project.
- Scroll down until you see the **Deploy** section.
- In the **Start Command** field, enter the command to run your main script. For example, if your main file is called `Main_bot_3.py`, enter:
