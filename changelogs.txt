## NOTE

**!view_historic Command Limitations**

The !view_historic command tracks invite usage and member joins only after it has been enabled. It cannot retroactively track members who joined before the command was activated. This is because Discord does not store historical data about which invite was used when a member joined. As a result, the command can only provide data for future joins, not past ones.

**Key Points:**

1. No Historical Data:
  - Discord does not save information about which invite was used for members who joined before the bot started tracking.

2. Future Tracking Only:
  - The command will only track invite usage and member joins from the moment it is enabled onward.

3. Real-Time Tracking:
  - For accurate data, ensure the bot is active and tracking invites when new members join.
